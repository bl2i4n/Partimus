# Partimus
Partimus is a non-profit organization that strives to provide educational opportunities using open source education and teaching. There website can be reached at http://partimus.org/

At Partimus we collaborated with East Bay Linux User group to determine the simplest Open source software to use for grade school students. We also had to determine the best way for the teacher to be able to have some sort of control of all the machines the students were using.

After deploying out to a school in Oakland we also had donated machines to deploy to a homeless shelter in Oakland. For these machine we just needed to supply browser access and we needed a way to push updates to the machine.

I did alot of the user end testing and contributed ideas for potential applications the user base could use.
